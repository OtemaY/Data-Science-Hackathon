Using Sentiment Analysis to detect the public's view on vaccinations

## Understanding the Problem

The Covid-19 virus shifted the trajectory of society when it hit on a global scale. The world came to a halt and caused many to rethink. It affected the way of life and took away many souls. In order to cleanse the earth of this deadly virus, there have been conversations surrounding the creation of a vaccine to boost human immunity to fight off the virus. 
However, there are varying views on the invention of a Covid-19 vaccine as there has been towards vaccines of other deadly viruses.

Processes:
Exploratory Data Analysis
Model Training and Validation

Language used: Python
Classification models:

RandomForestClassifier : Accuracy - 73%

NaiveBaiyesClassifier : Accuracy - 82%

Deployment platform: Microsoft Azure

## Summary and Impact

- Sentiments on vaccination are largely neutral
- Sentiments are positive when associated with children
- The model can help improve public health policy
- The model can help vaccine communication strategies, and vaccination programs across the world
